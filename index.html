    <h1>What is Single Page Application?</h1>

    <h2>
      Modern Web Applications are also called Single Page Applications.<br />What
      does this mean?
    </h2>

    <p>
      In the past, when browsers were much less capable than today, and
      JavaScript performance was poor, every page was coming from a server.
      Every time you clicked something, a new request was made to the server and
      the browser subsequently loaded the new page. Only very innovative
      products worked differently, and experimented with new approaches. Today,
      popularized by modern frontend JavaScript frameworks like React, an app is
      usually built as a single page application: you only load the application
      code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) once, and when you interact with the
      application, what generally happens is that JavaScript intercepts the
      browser events and instead of making a new request to the server that then
      returns a new document, the client requests some JSON or performs an
      action on the server but the page that the user sees is never completely
      wiped away, and behaves more like a desktop application. Single page
      applications are built in JavaScript (or at least compiled to JavaScript)
      and work in the browser. The technology is always the same, but the
      philosophy and some key components of how the application works are
      different.
